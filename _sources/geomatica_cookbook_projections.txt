**Projections**
=======================
This section provides some basic recipes for reprojecting rasters and vectors, as well as, resampling
imagery from the native resolution to a new user-defined resolution (ground sampling distance (GSD)). 

Create projection for an existing image file
---------------------------------------------------------
    Quickly check to ensure that Geomatica is correctly installed and licensed for your computer.
    Use the Python interpreter in the terminal/console for quickly checking the install and licensing. 

    .. code-block:: python

        #UNDER CONSTRUCTION
        
        
Reproject an image from one coordinate system to a different coordinate system
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This recipe uses a single Geomatica function to reproject an image from a UTM NAD83
    projected coordinate system to a Latitude and Longitude WGS84 geographic coordinate system

    .. code-block:: python
        
        from pci.reproj2 import reproj2

        input_file = r"C:\projection\landsat8_ms.pix" #UTM NAD83 projection
        reproj_file = r"C:\projection\reproj_image2.pix"
        resolution = [2.0, 2.0]
        map_units = "Long/Lat D000" #output will be longitude and latitude with WGS84

        reproj2(input_file, [], [], "", reproj_file, "", "", "",
                [], resolution, "YES", map_units, "", "", "", "", "", "", "")

        
Reproject a vector layer from one coordinate system to a different coordinate system
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This recipe uses a single Geomatica function to reproject a vector layer from a UTM NAD83
    projected coordinate system to a Latitude and Longitude WGS84 geographic coordinate system
    
    .. code-block:: python

        from pci.reproj2 import reproj2

        input_file = r"C:\projection\toronto_vector.pix" #UTM NAD83 projection
        vector_layers = [2,3]
        reproj_file = r"C:\projection\reproj_vectors.pix"
        resolution= [2.0, 2.0]
        map_units = "Long/Lat D000" #output will be longitude and latitude with WGS83

        reproj2(input_file, [], vector_layers, "VEC", reproj_file, "", "", "",
                [], resolution, "", map_units, "", "", "", "", "", "", "")
        

Resample Image channels
-----------------------
    This recipe demonstrates how to change the ground sampling distance (GSD) or image resolution
    from the inpu resolution to 4m resolution, using a cubic convolution resampling method.

    .. code-block:: python
        
        from pci.resamp import resamp
        
        input_file = r"c:\data\image.pix" #2m resolution data
        channels = [] #defaults to all channels
        resampled_file = r"c:\data\resampled_image.pix"
        resolution = [4.0, 4.0] #downsample from 2m to 4m resolution
        resample_method ="cubic" 
        
        resamp(input_file, channels, [], "", resampled_file, "", "", resolution, resample_method)
