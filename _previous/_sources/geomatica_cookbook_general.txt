**Geomatica Py General**
=================================
This section provides some basic recipes for importing pci libraries, accessing help, error handling and etc.

Check Installation of Geomatica Py Libraries
---------------------------------------------------------
    Quickly check to ensure that Geomatica is correctly installed and licensed for your computer.
    Use the Python interpreter in the terminal/console for quickly checking the install and licensing. 

    .. code-block:: python

        import pci 

        #If successful, the following will be printed to the console:
        #PCI Pluggable Framework environment successfully loaded
        #Otherwise, a PCI exception will be printed
        
        
Import Geomatica Py Libraries
---------------------------------------------------------
    This example explicitly imports the pansharp2 function from the pansharp2 module and imports
    all onjects and functions from the ortho2 module

    .. code-block:: python

        from pci.pansharp2 import pansharp2 #Imports the pansharp2 function/object from the pansharp2 module
        from pci.ortho2 import * #imports all of the functions and objects from the ortho2 module 

        
Accessing Help About Geomatica Py Function
---------------------------------------------------------
    Python prints help documentation to the terminal/console for the specified function. This includes information
    about the signature of the function (arguments that need to be passed) and information about what the function
    does. Furthermore, the help document includes information about what input data is required and what output is 
    produced.
    
    It is best to access this directly with the python interpreter in Geomatica's Focus or using a terminal/console
    

    .. code-block:: python

        from pci.pansharp2 import pansharp2 
        
        help(pansharp2)
        

Handling Geomatica Py Exceptions
---------------------------------------------------------
    This example demonstrates how to handle exceptions that may result from incorrectly invoking a Geomatica
    function. The main behaviour of this action is that the script will continue to run if the exception is called.
    This is mainly desirable when performing batch operations, so that if one file fails to run, the script will continue
    to process the other files

    .. code-block:: python

        from pci.pansharp2 import pansharp2
        from pci.exceptions import PCIException
        import sys

        ms_file = r"c:\NewYorkk_multispectral.pix" #this file is incorrectly spelt and thus, does not exist
        ms_channels = [1,2,3,4] #pansharpen channels 1 to 4 (Red, green, blue and NIR) 
        pan_file = r"c:\NewYork_panchromatic.pix"
        out_file = r"c:\NewYork_pansharpened.pix"

        try:
            pansharp2(ms_file, ms_channels, [], pan_file, [], out_file, [], "", [], "", "pix", "tiled512")
        except PCIException, e:
            print e
        except Exception, e:
            print e
            
        #This results in python printing a PCI caught exception that the input multispectral file does not exist
        #The script will continue to run through to the next line of code without exiting, because the exception
        #is handled with a print statement
