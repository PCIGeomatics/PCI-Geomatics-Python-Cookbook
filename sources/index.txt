Welcome to the Geomatica Python Cookbook!
=========================================

Welcome to PCI's Geomatica Python Cookbook. An online resource for Geomatica's Python Community. 

Geomatica's python library offers geospatial developers and solution providers with a powerful set
of remote sensing, photogrammetry, image processing, image analysis and information extraction 
tools.

This cookbook is great for new users looking to familiarize themselves with Geomatica's python 
library and common workflows.  It is also a great resource for more advanced 
users, as it contains useful code snippets that can be easily "plugged in" to a python script.
